CBD is having a major moment. CBD, short for Cannabidiol, is suddenly available at your local coffee shop, in cocktails, beauty products and even for your pets. But as popular as it’s become, there’s still a lot of confusion about it. “CBD is one of 146 known and identified cannabinoids that are found in the cannabis plant (and some other plants as well),” Dr. Stuart Titus, CEO of [HempMeds](https://hempmedspx.com/), explains. In 2018, hemp with a THC concentration of .3% or less was legalized as a supplement under the Farm Bill.

## CBD vs. THC

According to the same bill, marijuana is classified as any plant in cannabis family containing greater than .3% THC. Unlike THC, CBD is not psychoactive so it won’t get you high or intoxicated. “Non-psychoactive cannabinoids, such as CBD, are particularly advantageous to use because they avoid the toxicity that is encountered with THC in high doses,” Dr. Titus explains. “THC does confer psychoactive effects and can make one feel euphoric, hallucinate or feel extremely sleepy.”

## How does CBD work?

“For medical usage, it does seem that CBD acts upon certain receptor sites, such as GPR55. As a dietary supplement, we believe that CBD supports the health and optimal function of the human body's endogenous cannabinoid system, the largest self-regulatory system within the human body,” Dr. Titus explains. “Many who take CBD seem to be less stressed and move to a higher level of health and wellness.”

## CBD benefits

“Medically, the U.S. FDA has approved CBD for certain types of refractory epilepsy, the type of epileptic seizure disorder that becomes drug-resistant,” Dr. Titus says. “For those who take CBD as a supplement, many report less stress, better relaxation, better sleep and some report a crisper sense of focus. Some fatigued individuals report more energy and vitality.” Research also shows CBD may be beneficial for people suffering from social anxiety disorder. One [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28553229) showed that a single 300 mg dose of CBD reduced anxiety during public speaking.

## How much CBD should I take?

If you’re new to CBD, the best way is to start low and slow. You can build up to 1,500 mg a day if you respond positively. “As CBD may have side effects, including nausea, dry mouth, and decreased appetite, I recommend that people start with a low dosage supplement to make sure it works for their body,” says Whitney English MS, RDN of [Whitney E. RD](https://www.whitneyerd.com/). “Up to 1500 mg/day has been shown to be safe.”

## CBD beauty benefits

You can also try CBD topically in beauty products. “Some of CBD’s greatest beauty benefits are its antioxidant, anti-bacterial, antifungal and antimicrobial properties,” says Shauna Blanch, LMT, co-owner & COO of [Color Up](https://coloruptherapeutics.com/?v=7516fd43adaa). “Along with its ability to regulate sebum production and melanogenesis, as well as decrease inflammation and fight the effects of aging and  acne, it truly is a skin care powerhouse ingredient. We have hundreds of clients who use it for everything from anti-aging, acne and pigmentation, to psoriasis and eczema. ”Whether you want to try CBD in an eye cream or a body lotion, there’s plenty of options.

## CBD oil benefits and other ways to take it

Technically speaking, CBD oil should have two ingredients: cannabidiol dissolved in the oil from hemp or coconuts. But there are different doses and different kinds of CBD that you may find when shopping, such as broad spectrum and isolate. 

[Highline Wellness](https://highlinewellness.com/), an-NYC based company, offers CBD oil that has a fresh minty taste in various strengths: 250 mg, 500 mg and 750 mg in each bottle. “Highline Wellness uses broad spectrum CBD which means you get the positive effects of the different cannabinoids without any trace amounts of THC,” CEO + Highline cofounder Chris Roth explains. There are many different ways to take CBD: oil, gummies, topicals and even in beauty products.

“CBD oil is natural, can help to fight inflammation and can be used every day. It also comes in a variety of forms that are easy to use like tinctures, capsules or topical creams,” explains [SeraLabs](https://seralabshealth.com/) founder and CEO Nancy Duitch.

Winged CBD makes products formulated specifically for women.

## CBD for women

There’s now even a CBD brand formulated just for women called [Winged CBD](https://wingedcbd.com/). "Launching Winged specifically for women came out from my personal battle with anxiety and finding relief with CBD,” says founder Jessica Mulligan. “In talking to all the women in my life, I realized most of us struggle with these same anxious feelings–statistically women experience anxiety and depression at twice the rate as men do. All Winged formulas contain Evening Primrose Oil, a wild flower extract that helps balance hormones in women.”
